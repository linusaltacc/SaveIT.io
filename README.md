## Description

In India‚Äôs fast-growing quick commerce space, platforms like Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, and Blinkit offer lightning-fast delivery of groceries and daily essentials. However, for users, this often becomes a confusing experience. The same item is priced differently across platforms, delivery and platform fees vary, and there‚Äôs no single view to help make a smart buying decision.

Additionally, a hidden pattern is emerging: users are initially offered a low minimum order value (e.g., ‚Çπ99), which gradually increases to ‚Çπ199, ‚Çπ299, or even ‚Çπ499 as they continue using the app. This manipulation forces users to buy more than they need, leading to unnecessary spending just to meet the order threshold.

**SaveIT.io is an agentic AI-powered assistant that solves this problem.** It takes your shopping list, compares item availability and pricing across platforms, and instantly suggests the best place to buy‚Äîbased on total cost (items + delivery + platform fees - discounts) or delivery speed. It also alerts users when they're being nudged into spending more due to increased minimum cart values and helps them avoid buying extra, unwanted items.

The AI continuously learns from user preferences‚Äîwhether they prioritize cost or delivery time‚Äîand customizes future suggestions. This solution can also scale to other domains like electronics, clothing, and personal care.

**Benefits:**
- Saves time and effort in platform comparison
- Reduces unnecessary expenses
- Increases pricing transparency
- Promotes fair competition in quick commerce

SaveIT.io empowers users to buy smarter, not more‚Äîmaking quick commerce truly convenient and cost-effective.
